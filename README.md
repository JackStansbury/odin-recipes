a static website containing some recipes :)

So the project here is to use some basic HTML skillz to make a static website that contains some recipes. I think it'll be nice to just make something, solidify those theoretical ideas. So far we've only really covered links, images, lists, and like super basic <p> and <h*> elements so I guess we'll be getting comfy with the basics here. Not that I'm advanced whatsoever lol.
