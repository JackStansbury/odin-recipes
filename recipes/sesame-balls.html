    <h1>Sesame Balls</h1>

    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>When I go to dim sum, I look forward to warm, crispy sesame balls with red bean filling more than any other dish. Which is saying something because I fucking love a lot of other stuff at dim sum.</p>
    <p>It's just the perfect combination of textures and flavors. The outer crust is hot, crispy, and savory while still being light. Biting into gives way to a soft, steamy interior surrounding the treasure at the middle - sweet red bean paste! So fucking good, I'm actually getting hungry just writing this haha.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>4 chicken thighs</li>
        <li>1.5 cups chili peppers</li>
        <li>1.5 tbsp. Sichuan peppercorn</li>
        <li>1 root ginger, sliced</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Cube chicken and fry in hot oil until golden brown</li>
        <li>Remove chicken and transfer to paper towel lined plate</li>
