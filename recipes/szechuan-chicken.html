    <h1>Szechuan Chicken</h1>

    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This dish is the fucking BOMB. You can find this at any legit sichuan chinese restaurant and it's always fire (both in terms of taste and heat.</p>
    <p>Don't let the presence of the many red chilis frighten you away - it's easy enough to eat around them and they (along with szechuan peppercorn) provide the perfect balance of spice and numbing flavor to the dish</p>
